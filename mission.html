<p>We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to restoring and protecting native wildlife habitats.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create safe, life-sustaining sanctuaries with a focus on this delicate balance from the soil to the sky.</p>
<p>We are reintroducing native trees, berry vines, shrubs, and hazelnuts. This provides food and shelter year-round.</p>
<p>Through volunteer work, community support, observation and education, one regional temperate forest has improved habitats of the endangered spotted frog and seen a threefold increase in wildlife activity, including the return of the elusive Douglas squirrel, Steller’s jay, and Nuttall’s rabbit.</p>
